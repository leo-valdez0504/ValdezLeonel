        <h2>What is Celestial Bodies?</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/planet.jpg" alt="Universe">
        </div>
        <p><b>celestial body</b> is a natural object in space that astronomers study, such as a planet, star, moon, asteroid, comet, nebula, or galaxy. They are also known as astronomical objects, celestial objects, or heavenly bodies. 
                Here are some other things to know about</p>
            <p><b>celestial bodies:</b> <br>
                <b>Astronomical bodies vs. astronomical objects</b><br>
In astronomy, the terms <i>"celestial body"</i> and <i>"astronomical body"</i> are often used interchangeably. However, a celestial body is a single, tightly bound entity, while an astronomical object can be a complex structure made up of multiple bodies or other objects.</p>
            <p><b>Closest celestial body to Earth</b>
The <i>moon</i> is the closest celestial body to Earth, at a distance of about 384,400 kilometers. Venus and Mars are the next closest planets, at distances of 177.89 and 222.59 million kilometers, respectively.</p>
            <p><b>Black holes</b>
A <i>black hole</i> forms when a star or other celestial object collapses due to its own gravity.</p>

            <h2>Asteroid</h2>
            <p>An asteroid is a small rocky object that orbits the Sun, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. These celestial bodies are remnants from the early solar system, providing insight into its formation and the conditions that existed billions of years ago.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Most asteroids are located in the asteroid belt, a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. However, asteroids can be found throughout the solar system, with some in near-Earth space and others on paths that take them beyond the outer planets.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b> Asteroids vary greatly in size, shape, and composition. They range from small boulders to objects several hundred kilometers across. Some are spherical, while others are irregularly shaped. Their surfaces can be rocky, metallic, or a mix of both. Most asteroids are made of rock and metal, with some containing significant amounts of water and organic compounds.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility: </b>Asteroids are not usually visible to the naked eye because of their small size and distance from Earth. However, they can be observed with telescopes, especially when they pass close to Earth. The brightness of an asteroid depends on its size, distance from the Sun, and surface reflectivity. When a large asteroid comes close to Earth, it can be seen as a moving point of light in the night sky.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b> The first asteroid, Ceres, was discovered in 1801 by astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi. Since then, thousands of asteroids have been discovered, with many being located in the asteroid belt. Early astronomers thought these objects were planets, but as more were discovered, they were recognized as a distinct category of small celestial bodies.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b> Asteroids are important for understanding the history of the solar system, as they are remnants of the primordial material that formed the planets. Some asteroids are considered potential threats to Earth, leading to studies of their orbits to assess the risk of impact. In popular culture, asteroids are often associated with space exploration, potential disasters, and the origins of life on Earth, as some contain organic molecules and water.</p>

            <h2>Comet</h2>
            <p>A comet is a small icy body that orbits the Sun and becomes visible when it passes close to the Sun, forming a glowing coma and often a tail. Comets are considered "dirty snowballs" because they are composed mainly of ice, dust, and rocky material.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Comets can be found throughout the solar system. Most comets originate from the Oort Cloud or the Kuiper Belt, located far beyond Neptune. Their orbits can take them close to the Sun, within the inner solar system, and then out to the far reaches of the system, making them visible from Earth during certain times.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b> A comet's most distinctive features are its coma (a bright cloud of gas and dust) and its tail. The tail, which can extend millions of kilometers, always points away from the Sun due to the solar wind. The coma can appear as a bright, diffuse halo surrounding the nucleus of the comet. The nucleus itself is typically a few kilometers across and is made of ice and dust.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b> Comets are most visible when they pass close to the Sun, which can cause them to brighten dramatically. The best time to observe a comet is when it is closest to Earth, as it will appear brighter in the night sky. Some comets, like Halley’s Comet, are periodic and return to the inner solar system at regular intervals, while others are one-time visitors from distant parts of the solar system.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b> Comets have been known since ancient times, often viewed with awe and fear due to their sudden appearances. Historically, they were thought to be omens or signs from the gods. The most famous comet, Halley’s Comet, is visible from Earth approximately once every 76 years, and it was the first comet to be recognized as periodic by astronomer Edmond Halley in 1705.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b> In astrology, comets have often been associated with change, transformation, or the heralding of significant events. Halley’s Comet, for instance, has appeared during several important moments in history. Scientifically, comets provide insight into the early solar system as they are remnants from its formation, offering clues about the conditions that existed in the distant past.</p>

            <h2>Milky Way</h2>
            <p>The Milky Way is a vast and awe-inspiring galaxy that contains our solar system, along with billions of other stars and their planets. It is a barred spiral galaxy, which means it has a central bar-shaped structure with spiral arms extending outward.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b> The Milky Way stretches across the entire sky, and its center lies in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. It is visible in both hemispheres, but it is most prominent in the Southern Hemisphere, where the dense core and bright star fields are most apparent.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b> The Milky Way appears as a wide, luminous band of stars, dust, and gas, creating a glowing path across the night sky. It is most striking when observed from areas free of light pollution. The galaxy is composed of over 200 billion stars, and its spiral arms contain star clusters, nebulae, and regions of active star formation. The center of the Milky Way is particularly dense and contains a supermassive black hole known as Sagittarius A*.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b> The best time to view the Milky Way is during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere and winter months in the Southern Hemisphere. The Milky Way is most visible from April to September, especially on clear, dark nights away from city lights. The central band of the galaxy is brightest and most noticeable in the southern sky.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b> The name <i>"Milky Way"</i> comes from its appearance as a dim, milky band of light. Ancient cultures often interpreted this as a river of milk, with the Greeks calling it the "Galaxias Kyklos," or "milky circle." In many ancient mythologies, the Milky Way was thought to represent various mythological pathways or celestial objects. For example, in Greek mythology, it was linked to the milk of Hera, the queen of the gods.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b> In modern astronomy, the Milky Way is crucial to our understanding of the universe. It serves as a reference point for studying other galaxies. Astrologically, some believe the Milky Way holds spiritual significance, symbolizing a pathway or bridge between earthly life and the cosmos.
                <br>
In the field of science, the study of the Milky Way has helped astronomers better understand the structure, composition, and evolution of galaxies across the universe.</p>

            <h2>Planets</h2>
            <p>Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, including our Sun, and are prominent objects within a solar system. They come in a variety of sizes and compositions, ranging from rocky terrestrial planets to gas giants.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b>
Planets are located in orbit around stars. In our solar system, the eight planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) orbit the Sun at varying distances. Planets can be found in other star systems, known as exoplanetary systems, as well.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
Planets vary greatly in appearance, depending on their composition and atmosphere. Terrestrial planets, like Earth and Mars, have rocky surfaces and can be seen through telescopes as solid, round bodies. Gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn, have thick atmospheres and are mostly made of gases, with colorful cloud bands visible through telescopes. Ice giants like Uranus and Neptune are composed primarily of icy materials. Some planets, like Earth, have visible weather patterns and surface features, while others appear as featureless disks.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
Planets can be observed with the naked eye, especially the brighter ones like Venus, Jupiter, and Mars. They usually appear as steady points of light, unlike stars, which twinkle. The visibility of planets changes throughout the year as they move along their orbits. Planets are often most visible at specific times depending on their position relative to Earth and the Sun.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b>
Planets have been known since ancient times, with the five planets visible to the naked eye (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) being observed by early civilizations. The ancient Greeks and Romans named the planets after gods, and the movements of these celestial bodies were used in early astronomical calculations. The heliocentric model of the solar system, proposed by Copernicus in the 16th century, revolutionized our understanding of planets and their orbits.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
Planets are central to both astronomy and astrology. In astronomy, they are classified into two broad categories: inner planets (rocky planets) and outer planets (gas giants and ice giants). In astrology, each planet is associated with specific traits or influences on human behavior, such as Mars (action and aggression) or Venus (love and beauty). Planets outside our solar system are also known as exoplanets, and astronomers study them to learn more about other solar systems and the potential for habitable worlds.</p>

            <h2>Sun</h2>
            <p>Sun is the central star of our solar system and the most important celestial body for life on Earth, providing light, heat, and energy.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b>
The Sun is located at the center of the solar system, about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from Earth. It is situated in the Milky Way galaxy, within the Orion Arm, a spiral arm of the galaxy.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
The Sun appears as a bright, yellowish ball of light in the sky, visible during the day. It is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion at its core. This fusion process produces vast amounts of energy, which radiates outward. The surface of the Sun, known as the photosphere, is a swirling mass of gas and plasma. It also has features such as sunspots, solar flares, and prominences that appear during periods of solar activity.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
The Sun is visible from Earth every day, providing daylight and influencing the cycles of day and night. Its appearance is best observed during sunrise and sunset, when it is low on the horizon and its colors can appear more vivid, ranging from yellow to orange or red. The Sun is most prominent in the sky during midday when it is directly overhead.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b>
The Sun has been a key object in many ancient cultures, often worshipped as a god or associated with creation. In ancient Egypt, the Sun was represented by the god Ra, while in Greek mythology, it was personified as Helios. The Sun's movements and cycles influenced the development of calendars and timekeeping systems across civilizations. The study of the Sun, particularly solar phenomena, began to significantly advance with the invention of telescopes in the 17th century.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
The Sun is the first and most important celestial body in astrology, governing the zodiac sign Leo (July 23 - August 22). In astrology, the Sun represents the self, identity, ego, and vitality. Scientifically, the Sun is classified as a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) and is about 4.6 billion years old. It will continue to shine for several billion more years before eventually evolving into a red giant and then a white dwarf.</p>

            <h2>Moon</h2>
            <p>Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and one of the most prominent celestial bodies in the night sky, visible throughout the year.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b>
The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) and can be seen from virtually every location on Earth. It rises in the east and sets in the west due to Earth’s rotation.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
The Moon’s appearance changes throughout its roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle, with phases ranging from the new moon, to the first quarter, full moon, and last quarter. The surface of the Moon is covered with craters, maria (dark volcanic plains), and highlands, which are visible to the naked eye. During a full moon, it appears as a bright, round disk, while in its crescent phase, only a small portion is visible.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
The Moon is visible from Earth nearly every night, although its appearance changes in size and brightness depending on its phase. It is most easily observed during the full moon phase, which occurs about once a month. However, its visibility can vary based on local weather conditions and its position in the sky.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b>
The Moon has been an object of fascination and study for thousands of years, influencing calendars, mythology, and early scientific inquiry. It was integral to the development of timekeeping and agricultural cycles in many ancient civilizations. In Greek mythology, the Moon was personified as the goddess Selene or Artemis. The Moon has also been a central subject in various cultures’ astronomy and mythological traditions.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
The Moon is integral to Earth’s tides, influencing ocean currents through its gravitational pull. In astrology, the Moon represents emotions, instincts, and subconscious drives. It is also the focus of scientific exploration, with human missions landing on its surface during the Apollo program between 1969 and 1972.</p>
