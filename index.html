            <p>A <i>celestial body</i> is a natural object in space that astronomers study, such as a planet, star, moon, asteroid, comet, nebula, or galaxy. They are also known as astronomical objects, celestial objects, or heavenly bodies. 
                Here are some other things to know about</p>
            <p><b>celestial bodies:</b><br>
<b>Astronomical bodies vs. astronomical objects</b>
In astronomy, the terms <i>"celestial body"</i> and <i>"astronomical body"</i> are often used interchangeably. However, a celestial body is a single, tightly bound entity, while an astronomical object can be a complex structure made up of multiple bodies or other objects.</p>
            <p><b>Closest celestial body to Earth</b>
The moon is the closest celestial body to Earth, at a distance of about 384,400 kilometers. Venus and Mars are the next closest planets, at distances of 177.89 and 222.59 million kilometers, respectively.</p>
            <p><b>Black holes</b>
A black hole forms when a star or other celestial object collapses due to its own gravity.</p>

            <p>A star constellation is a group of stars that are perceived to form a recognizable pattern or shape in the night sky. These patterns are typically named after mythological figures, animals, or objects, and are used to help astronomers and stargazers navigate and identify stars. The constellations we see today have been shaped by both cultural and scientific history.</p>
            <p>Stars the building blocks of galaxies. They are massive spheres of hot, glowing gas, primarily made up of hydrogen and helium. Stars go through a life cycle from birth to death, with various stages including red giants and supernovae.</p>
            <p>There are 88 officially recognized constellations, as defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Some of the most well-known constellations include:</p>
            <p><b>Orion:</b> Representing a hunter, it is one of the most prominent and easily identifiable constellations in the sky.</p>
            <p><b>Ursa Major:</b> Home to the Big Dipper, it is often used for navigation.</p>
            <p><b>Scorpius:</b> A constellation shaped like a scorpion.</p>
            <p><b>Leo:</b> Representing a lion, it is a prominent constellation during spring.</p>
            <p>While the stars in a constellation may appear close to each other in the sky, they are often vastly distant from one another in space. Constellations serve as a way to organize the night sky and are a key part of celestial navigation and astronomy.</p>

            <p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that orbits a star, stellar remnant, or brown dwarf. The word "planet" comes from the Greek word planÄ“t, which means "wanderer".</p>           
            <p>Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars. Our Solar System has eight planets, including Earth. Planets come in many different sizes and types, from rocky planets like Earth to gas giants like Jupiter.</p>
            <p>Here are some characteristics of planets:</p>
            <p><b>Orbit:</b> Planets orbit the sun or another star in a path that is usually circular.</p>
            <p><b>Size:</b> Planets are usually large enough to have been squeezed into a sphere by their own gravity.</p>
            <p><b>Atmosphere:</b> Most planets have an atmosphere, which is a layer of gases that surrounds them.</p>
            <p><b>Moons:</b> Most planets have at least one moon.</p>
            <p>In our solar system, there are eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was previously considered a planet, but is now classified as a dwarf planet</p>
