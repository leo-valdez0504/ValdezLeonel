        </div>
        <p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is generally required to be in orbit around a star, stellar remnant, or brown dwarf, and is not one itself.[1] The Solar System has eight planets by the most restrictive definition of the term: the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, a process called accretion.

The word planet comes from the Greek πλανήται (planḗtai) 'wanderers'. In antiquity, this word referred to the Sun, Moon, and five points of light visible to the naked eye that moved across the background of the stars—namely, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Planets have historically had religious associations: multiple cultures identified celestial bodies with gods, and these connections with mythology and folklore persist in the schemes for naming newly discovered Solar System bodies. Earth itself was recognized as a planet when heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

            <h2>Mercury</h2>
			<div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/mercury.jpg"></a>
           </div>
            <p><b>Mercury</b> is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system, known for its extreme temperature variations and rapid orbit around the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet, similar in composition to Earth, with a thin atmosphere and a surface that experiences extreme conditions.</p>

            <p><b>Location:</b>
Mercury is located between the Sun and Venus, making it the first planet in the solar system. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 57.9 million kilometers (35.98 million miles) and has an orbital period of approximately 88 Earth days. Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not visible to the naked eye for most of the time, but it can be observed during certain periods just before sunrise or after sunset.</p>

            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
Mercury has a rocky, cratered surface that resembles Earth's Moon, with large impact craters and smooth plains. It is a small planet, about 38% the size of Earth, and has no moons. The surface temperature can vary widely, from extremely hot during the day (up to 430°C or 800°F) to frigidly cold at night (down to -180°C or -290°F), due to its lack of a significant atmosphere. The planet appears grayish in color when viewed from space.</p>

            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
Mercury is difficult to observe due to its proximity to the Sun, and it is usually seen during twilight hours—just before sunrise or after sunset. The planet appears as a small, bright dot in the sky and is most visible during its "greatest elongation," when it is furthest from the Sun in the sky. This occurs several times a year, and is the best time to observe Mercury with the naked eye or a telescope.</p>

            <p><b>History:</b>
The planet Mercury has been known since ancient times, and its swift motion across the sky led to its association with the Roman god Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Early astronomers, including the Babylonians and Greeks, observed the planet and noted its rapid movements. In modern times, Mercury has been studied by spacecraft, including Mariner 10, which flew by the planet in the 1970s, and MESSENGER, which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015.</p>

            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and has a very thin atmosphere, made up mostly of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen. The planet’s extreme temperature variations and lack of substantial atmosphere make it inhospitable to life. In astrology, Mercury is associated with communication, intellect, and travel, and its retrograde motion is often linked to disruptions or misunderstandings in these areas.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. However, it is a hostile world with a thick, toxic atmosphere and extreme surface conditions.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Venus lies between Mercury to the west and Earth to the east, orbiting the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles). It has an orbital period of 225 Earth days, completing one orbit around the Sun before Earth completes its own.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance: </b>Venus has a thick, cloudy atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. Its surface is hidden from view, but radar mapping has revealed a rocky, volcanic landscape with large plains, mountain ranges, and impact craters. Venus has a yellowish hue when observed from space due to the reflection of sunlight off its thick clouds. The planet's surface temperature is extremely hot, reaching up to 465°C (869°F), hotter than Mercury, even though it is farther from the Sun.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility: </b>Venus is one of the brightest objects in the sky and can be seen with the naked eye. It is often referred to as the "Morning Star" or "Evening Star," depending on its position in its orbit relative to Earth. Venus is most visible during dawn or dusk, as it is never visible in the middle of the night. It can be observed in the sky for several weeks at a time, alternating between being visible before sunrise or after sunset.</p>
            <p><b>History: </b>Venus has been known since ancient times and has been a subject of fascination for many cultures. The ancient Greeks and Romans named the planet after their respective goddesses of love, Aphrodite and Venus. In modern astronomy, Venus has been studied by several spacecraft, including NASA's Magellan mission, which mapped its surface using radar. Venus is often a focus of planetary research due to its extreme atmosphere and geological activity.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b> In astrology, Venus is associated with love, beauty, and harmony, influencing relationships and artistic endeavors. Despite its inhospitable conditions, Venus continues to capture the imagination of scientists, who study it for insights into planetary climates, atmospheric processes, and the potential for future exploration.</p>

            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse environment, with oceans, continents, and a breathable atmosphere, which make it unique among the planets in our solar system.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b>
Earth lies between Venus to the west and Mars to the east, orbiting the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles). It has an orbital period of 365.25 days, completing one revolution around the Sun in one year.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
Earth is a blue planet due to the presence of vast oceans that cover around 71% of its surface. The landmasses are green, brown, and white, depending on vegetation and ice coverage. The atmosphere is composed mostly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), giving the planet a clear, blue sky when viewed from space. Earth also has a natural satellite, the Moon, which affects tides and stabilizes the planet’s rotation.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
Earth is the only planet we can observe in great detail from its surface, though from space, it is easily recognizable as a vibrant, mostly blue orb. It is visible to distant observers as part of the solar system, and from space, the Earth is often photographed, showing its polar ice caps, oceans, and cloud cover.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b>
Earth has been inhabited by life for billions of years, evolving through various geological and biological stages. The planet's age is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years, and it has gone through significant changes, such as the formation of the continents, the development of an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and the rise of complex life. Humans first began exploring the planet from space in the mid-20th century, which revolutionized our understanding of Earth's place in the universe.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
Earth is the only planet known to support life, making it central to humanity’s understanding of the universe.

			<div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/uranus.jpg"></a>
        </div>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique in the solar system due to its tilted axis, which causes extreme seasonal variations. It is an ice giant, composed mostly of water, ammonia, and methane, and has a striking blue-green appearance.</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b>
Uranus lies between Saturn to the west and Neptune to the east, orbiting the Sun at an average distance of about 2.9 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles). It takes approximately 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun, making a year on Uranus much longer than one on Earth.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
Uranus has a pale blue-green color due to the methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue-green light. The planet has a faint ring system, which was discovered in 1977, and numerous moons. Unlike other planets, Uranus rotates on its side, with its poles almost pointing directly at the Sun. This unique tilt results in extreme seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
Uranus is not visible to the naked eye but can be observed through a telescope. It appears as a faint, pale blue-green dot in the sky. Uranus is best observed when it is at opposition, when it is closest to Earth, making it easier to spot with a telescope. Due to its faintness, it is often overlooked by casual stargazers.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b>
Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope, by William Herschel in 1781. Its discovery was groundbreaking as it was the first planet to be found in modern times, expanding our understanding of the solar system. Uranus was named after the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) in Greek mythology.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
In astrology, Uranus is associated with change, innovation, and rebellion. It is seen as the planet of unexpected events, breakthroughs, and revolution.

            <p><b>Location:</b>
Neptune lies between Uranus to the west and the Kuiper Belt to the east, orbiting the Sun at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles). It takes approximately 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun, making a year on Neptune over 160 times longer than a year on Earth.</p>
            <p><b>Appearance:</b>
Neptune has a striking blue color due to the methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue wavelengths. The planet is known for its strong winds, the fastest in the solar system, and its dynamic weather patterns. Neptune has a faint ring system and at least 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity.</p>
            <p><b>Visibility:</b>
Neptune is not visible to the naked eye but can be observed through a telescope. It appears as a faint, bluish disk, and is best observed when it is at opposition, when it is closest to Earth. Due to its distance, Neptune is challenging to study and requires powerful telescopes for detailed observation.</p>
            <p><b>History:</b>
Neptune was discovered in 1846 by astronomers Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest, who used mathematical predictions based on Uranus' orbit to find the planet. It was named after the Roman god of the sea due to its deep blue color. The discovery of Neptune confirmed the existence of another planet beyond Uranus, expanding our understanding of the solar system.</p>
            <p><b>Other associations:</b>
In astrology, Neptune is associated with illusion, dreams, and spirituality. It governs creativity, intuition, and the subconscious. Neptune is the ruling planet of Pisces, often linked to mysticism, compassion, and idealism. Its association with the sea and its blue color also symbolizes the depths of emotion, mystery, and the unknown.</p>
